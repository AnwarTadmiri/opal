# Monitoring OPAL

There are multiple ways you can monitor your OPAL deployment:

- **Logs** - Using the structured logs outputted to stderr by both the OPAL-servers and OPAL-clients
- **Health-checks** - OPAL exposes HTTP health check endpoints ([See below](##health-checks))
- [**Callbacks**](/tutorials/healthcheck_policy_and_update_callbacks#-data-update-callbacks) - Using the callback webhooks feature - having OPAL-clients report their updates
- **Statistics** - Using the built-in statistics feature in OPAL ([See below](##opal-statistics))
- **Prometheus Metrics** - OPAL can expose metrics in Prometheus format for monitoring ([See below](#prometheus-metrics)).

## Health checks

### OPAL Server

opal-server exposes http health check endpoints on `/` & `/healthcheck`. <br/>
Currently it returns `200 OK` as long as server is up.

### OPAL Client

opal-client exposes 2 types of http health checks:

- **Readiness** - available on `/ready`. <br/>
  Returns `200 OK` if the client have loaded policy & data to OPA at least once (from either server, or local backup file), otherwise `503 Unavailable` is returned.

- **Liveness** - available on `/`, `/healthcheck` & `/healthy`. <br/>
  Returns `200 OK` if the last attempts to load policy & data to OPA were successful, otherwise `503 Unavailable` is returned

**Notice:** if you don't except your opal-client to load any data into OPA, set `OPAL_DATA_UPDATER_ENABLED: False`, so opal-client could report being healthy.

You can also configure opal-client to store dynamic health status as a document in OPA, [Learn more here](/tutorials/healthcheck_policy_and_update_callbacks)

## OPAL Statistics

By enabling `OPAL_STATISTICS_ENABLED=true` (on both servers and clients), the OPAL-Server would start maintaining a unified state of all the clients and which topics they've subscribed to.
The state can then be retrieved as a JSON object by calling the `/statistics` api route on the server

### Code Reference:

- [opal_server/statistics.py](https://github.com/permitio/opal/blob/master/packages/opal-server/opal_server/statistics.py)


## OPAL Client tracker (EAP)

Alternative implementation for the Statistics feature, OPAL-Server tracks all OPAL-clients connected through websocket.
Gathered information includes connection details (client's source host and port), connection time, and subscribed topics.
Available through `/pubsub_client_info` api route on the server.

### Caveats:
- When `UVICORN_NUM_WORKERS > 1`, retrieved information would only include clients connected to the replying server process.
- This is an early access feature and is likely to change. Backward compatibility is not garaunteed.

## Prometheus Metrics

OPAL can expose metrics in Prometheus format, which can be scraped by Prometheus for monitoring and alerting.

### Enabling Prometheus Metrics

Prometheus metrics are enabled by default on both OPAL Server and OPAL Client.

Both the server and client expose a `/metrics` endpoint that returns metrics in Prometheus format.

### Accessing Metrics

- **OPAL Server Metrics Endpoint**: `/metrics`
- **OPAL Client Metrics Endpoint**: `/metrics`

### Example

To monitor OPAL using Prometheus and Grafana, a ready-to-use Docker Compose configuration is provided in the root directory of the repository under docker/prometheus. The file is named docker-compose-with-prometheus-metrics.yml.

Navigate to the directory containing the Docker Compose file:

```
cd docker/prometheus
```
Run the following command to start Prometheus and Grafana:

```
docker compose -f docker-compose-with-prometheus-metrics.yml up
```

This setup will start Prometheus to scrape metrics from OPAL server and client, and Grafana to visualize the metrics.
