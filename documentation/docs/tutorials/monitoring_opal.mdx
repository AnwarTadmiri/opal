# Monitoring OPAL

There are multiple ways you can monitor your OPAL deployment:

- **Logs** - Using the structured logs outputted to stderr by both the OPAL-servers and OPAL-clients
- **Health-checks** - OPAL exposes HTTP health check endpoints ([See below](##health-checks))
- [**Callbacks**](/tutorials/healthcheck_policy_and_update_callbacks#-data-update-callbacks) - Using the callback webhooks feature - having OPAL-clients report their updates
- **Statistics** - Using the built-in statistics feature in OPAL ([See below](##opal-statistics))

## Health checks

### OPAL Server

opal-server exposes http health check endpoints on `/` & `/healthcheck`. <br/>
Currently it returns `200 OK` as long as server is up.

### OPAL Client

opal-client exposes http health check endpoints on `/` & `/healthcheck`. <br/>
The health check returns `200 OK` when both policy and data were successfully loaded into OPA, otherwise `503 Unavailable` is returned

**Notice:** if you don't except your opal-client to load any data into OPA, set `OPAL_DATA_UPDATER_ENABLED: False`, so opal-client could report being healthy.

You can also configure opal-client to store dynamic health status in OPA, [Learn more here](/tutorials/healthcheck_policy_and_update_callbacks)

## OPAL Statistics

By enabling `OPAL_STATISTICS_ENABLED=true` (on both servers and clients), the OPAL-Server would start maintaining a unified state of all the clients and which topics they've subscribed to.
The state can then be retrieved as a JSON object by calling the `/statistics` api route on the server
