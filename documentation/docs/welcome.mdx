**OPAL** stands for **Open Policy Administration Layer**. OPAL is an administration layer for Policy Engines such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.openpolicyagent.org/">Open Policy Agent (OPA)</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/permitio/cedar-agent">AWS' Cedar Agent</a>, allowing us to detect changes
made to our policies and data, and thus pushing live real-time updates to your agents.

OPAL is designed to work with **live applications**, and bring policy to a real-time speed. As updates are pushed to application
stores - this could be your Git, your databases, SaaS services and so on - **OPAL will make sure the services are always in sync**
with the authorization data and policy they need, and more importantly, **only** the services that they need.
