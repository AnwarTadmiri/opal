## OPAL 0.5.0 -

This release contains several small fixes and improvements.

#### New Features - Bundle Ignore

Added support for omitting files in the bundle produced by opal-server. Use the `OPAL_BUNDLE_IGNORE` environment
variable to specify a list of comma separated glob paths which if matched will ignore a file from being included in
the policy bundle.

#### Bug fix - [Bitbucket Webhook](https://github.com/permitio/opal/issues/381):

When sending a webhook from Bitbucket to the OPAL server with an secret configured then the the response on the
request is an 401, no secret was provided. This is unexpected as the configuration looks correct.

#### Bug fix - [Configuration default casting](https://github.com/permitio/opal/pull/371)

#### Improve usability of topics in data updates

1. Have the default topic (policy_data) as a default value for `DataSourceEntry.topics` - To prevent users who have left
   this empty before from experiencing breaking changes as a result of related bug fixes in `0.4.0`. This also fixes [#375](https://github.com/permitio/opal/issues/375): Uncaught server exception when posting data update without topics.

2. Warn a user at realtime when published entry doesn't have topics, or when client processes data update with no matching entries
   (this would cover what isn't covered by 1).

3. Fix documentation about topics in data updates.

#### CI Fixes

1. Fixes broken pre commits.
2. Install `jq` to client and server
